# Image Classification Web Application

## Project Description

The Image Classification Web Application is designed to allow users to upload images and classify them into predefined categories such as animals, vehicles, and plants. This application leverages computer vision techniques and a pre-trained deep learning model to provide accurate image classifications.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images for classification.
- **Image Preprocessing:** The application preprocesses images by resizing and normalizing them.
- **Model Classification:** Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) to classify images.
- **Results Display:** Displays the predicted category and confidence score for each uploaded image.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x 
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ````

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
    cd image-classification-app
   ```
3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional):**
    
     - Create a virtual environment:
       ```bash
        python -m venv venv
       ```
    
    - Create a virtual environment:
       ```bash
        python -m venv venv
       ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
        - On Windows:
           ```bash
            venv\Scripts\activate
           ```
        - On macOS/Linux:
           ```bash
          source venv/bin/activate
           ```
    
4. **Install the Required Dependencies:**
    
5. **Run the Application:**
   
       ```bash
          python app.py
       ```

## **Usage**
   
    1. **Open the Web Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or the URL provided in the output).
   
    2. **Upload an Image:**
    Use the provided upload button to select and upload an image file.

    4. **View Classification Results:**
    The application will display the predicted category and confidence score for the uploaded image.
