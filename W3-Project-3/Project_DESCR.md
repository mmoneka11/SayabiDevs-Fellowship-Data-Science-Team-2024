# Image Classification App

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web application that enables users to upload images and classify them into predefined categories, such as animals, vehicles, and plants. It serves as an introduction to basic concepts in computer vision and image processing. The application leverages pre-trained deep learning models to provide accurate classifications and offers an intuitive interface for user interaction.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images from their local devices for classification.
- **Image Preprocessing:** The uploaded images are preprocessed by resizing and normalizing them to ensure compatibility with the model.
- **Model Utilization:** A pre-trained model, such as MobileNet or ResNet, is used for efficient and accurate image classification.
- **Classification Output:** The app displays the predicted category and confidence score for each uploaded image, allowing users to understand the classification result.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Flask or Django for creating the web application
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and using the image classification model
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV or PIL for handling and preprocessing images
- **Deployment:** Heroku or AWS for hosting and deploying the web application

## Learning Objectives

- **Computer Vision Basics:** Gain an understanding of essential concepts in computer vision, including image processing and classification.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Learn how to work with pre-trained deep learning models for efficient image classification.
- **Web Interface Development:** Build a simple yet effective web interface that allows users to interact with the image classification model.
- **AI Application Deployment:** Explore the process of deploying AI-powered applications in a web environment, ensuring they are accessible and user-friendly.
